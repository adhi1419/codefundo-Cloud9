<h3>DURING A FLOOD</h3>

Be alert.

    Monitor your surroundings.
    Monitor NOAA Weather Radio, local television and radio stations, or go to www.weather.gov.

Don’t drive unless you have to.
If you must drive, travel with care.

    Make sure your vehicle has enough fuel.
    Follow recommended routes. DO NOT sightsee.
    Avoid disaster areas. Your presence might hamper rescue or other emergency operations and put you at further risk.
    Watch for washed out roads, earth slides, and downed trees or power lines.
    Be especially cautious at night, when it is harder to recognize flood dangers.
    If the vehicle stalls, abandon it.
    If water rises around your car, leave the vehicle immediately. Climb to higher ground as quickly as possible.

NEVER drive through flooded roadways. STOP! Turn Around Don’t Drown.

    The roadbed may be washed out.
    You can lose control of your vehicle in only a few inches of water.
    Your car may float. Vehicles can be swept away by less than 2 feet of water.
    Do not drive around a barricade. Turn around and go another way!

Get to high ground – Climb to safety!

    Get out of low areas that may be subject to flooding.
    Avoid already-flooded areas and do not attempt to cross flowing water.
    Stay away from power lines and electrical wires.

Evacuate immediately, if you think you are at risk or are advised to do so!

    Act quickly. Save yourself, not your belongings.
    Move to a safe area before access is cut off by rising water.
    Families should use only one vehicle to avoid getting separated and reduce traffic jams.
    Shut off water, gas, and electrical services before leaving.
    Secure your home: lock all doors and windows.
    If directed to a specific location, go there.

Never try to walk or swim through flowing water.

    If flowing water is above your ankles, STOP! Turn around and go another way.
    If it is moving swiftly, water 6 inches deep can knock you off your feet.
    Be aware that people have been swept away wading through flood waters.
    NEVER allow children to play around high water, storm drains, creeks, or rivers.

Shut off the electricity at the circuit breakers.
If someone falls in or is trapped in flood water:

    Do not go after the victim!
    Use a floatation device. If possible throw the victim something to help them float, such as a spare tire, large ball, or foam ice chest.
    Call 911. Call for assistance and give the correct location information.

<h3>AFTER A FLOOD</h3>

Wait until it is safe to return.

    Monitor NOAA Weather Radio or local television and radio stations.
    Do not return to flooded areas until authorities indicate it is safe to do so.
    Do not visit disaster areas following a flood. Your presence may hamper urgent emergency response and rescue operations.

Travel with care.

    Follow recommended routes. DO NOT sightsee.
    Watch for washed out roads, earth slides, and downed trees or power lines.
    Stay away from downed power lines.

If a building was flooded, check for safety before entering.

    Do not enter a building if it is still flooded or surrounded by floodwater.
    Check for structural damage. Inspect foundations for cracks or other damage.
    Turn off any outside gas lines at the meter tank.
    Do not enter a building that has flooded until local building officials have inspected it for safety.

Use extreme caution when entering buildings.

    Wear sturdy shoes. The most common injury following a disaster is cut feet.
    Use ONLY battery-powered lighting. Flammable material may be present.
    Look for fire hazards (such as damaged gas lines, flooded electrical circuits, or submerged furnaces).
    Check for gas leaks. If you smell gas or hear a blowing or hissing noise, open a window and quickly leave the building. If possible turn off the gas at the outside main valve. Call the gas company.
    Report broken utility lines to appropriate authorities.
    Check for electrical system damage (sparks, broken or frayed wires, or the smell of burning insulation). Turn off the electricity at the main circuit breaker if you can reach it without stepping in water.
    Examine walls, floors, doors, windows, and ceilings for risk of collapsing.
    Watch out for animals that might have entered with the floodwaters.
    Let the building air out to remove foul odors or escaping gas.

Take pictures of the damage, both of the building and its contents, for insurance claims.

Get professional help.

    Seek necessary medical care. Do not neglect minor wounds or illnesses.
    Food, clothing, shelter, and first aid are available from the American Red Cross.
    If the gas has been turned off for any reason, it must be turned back on by a professional.
    Have an electrician check the electrical system and appliances.
    Wells should be pumped out and the water tested for purity before drinking.

Your home is no longer a safe place.

    Throw away medicine, food, or water that had contact with floodwaters (including canned goods).
    If water is of questionable purity, boil drinking water for 10 minutes.
    Restrict children from playing in flooded areas.
    Keep windows and doors open for ventilation.
    Pump out flooded basements gradually (removing about 1/3 of the water volume each day) to avoid structural damage.
    Keep the power off until an electrician has inspected the system for safety. All electrical equipment should be checked and dried before being returned to service.
    Clean and disinfect everything that got wet.
    Service damaged sewage systems as soon as possible.

When making repairs, protect your property from future flood damage.

    Follow local building codes.
    Use flood-resistant materials and techniques.
    Elevate electrical components above the potential flood height.
    Elevate utilities (washer, dryer, furnace, and water heater) above the level of anticipated flooding.
    Consider elevation of the entire structure.
    Install a backflow valve in the sewer system.



<h2 id="C2"> Cyclone </h2>

<h3>Before</h3>
Prepare your home:

    Ask your local council if your home is built to cyclone standards.
    Are you adequately insured? Make sure it covers you for storm surge, flooding and cyclone damage, including clean-up and debris removal.
    Check your roof and repair any loose tiles, eaves or roof screws.
    Ensure windows are fitted with shutters or metal screens.
    Trim any branches hanging over your house and clear gutters of leaves and debris.
    Make sure your household is familiar with the Standard Emergency Warning Signal (SEWS), which is generally broadcast when a cyclone is 12 hours or less away.
    Decide how you will look after your pets and what you will do if you have to leave them behind.

If you hear either a watch or a warning, you should:

    Stay tuned to your local ABC station on a battery-powered radio and check the ABC Emergency Twitter and Facebook pages regularly for instructions and updates on the cyclone.
    Familiarise yourself with some of the facts behind tropical cyclones through the Bureau of Meteorology.
    Check that your emergency survival kit is complete and have it on hand.
    Let neighbours know a cyclone watch/warning has been issued.
    Clear your property of all loose items and bring outdoor furniture, children's toys and gardening equipment inside or under cover.
    Secure boats. Move vehicles/bicycles under cover.
    Fill buckets and bath with water (in case your water supply gets cut off). Make sure you have enough water purification tablets.
    If your windows are fitted with shutters, make sure they are closed securely. If not, tape your windows in a criss-crossing fashion using strong packing tape (this will hold broken glass in place).
    Bring children and pets indoors and remain inside until told otherwise.
    Let friends and family know where you are.

<h3>During</h3>
    If you shelter at home:

    Turn off all electricity, gas and water; unplug all appliances.
    Keep your emergency kit close at hand.
    Bring your family into the strongest part of the house.
    Keep listening to the radio for cyclone updates.
    If the building begins to break up, shelter under a strong table, bench or heavy mattress.
    Beware the calm eye of the cyclone: stay inside until told it is safe to go outside.
    Comfort children.

When an official evacuation order is issued:

    Act immediately. You and your family should follow directions; seek a public shelter or stay with friends/family further inland or on higher ground.
    Check with your neighbours that they have received the updated information.
    Turn off all electricity, gas and water; unplug all appliances.
    Lock your doors.
    Make sure everyone in your household is wearing strong shoes and suitable clothing.
    Take your emergency survival kit; commence your evacuation plan.
    Visiting from out of town? The local council or emergency agency will let you know your best options for evacuation.
    If you cannot take your pets with you, make sure they are in a safe place (garage, laundry, etc). Leave them with food and water. Do not tie them up.
    Comfort children.
    If you are driving when a cyclone hits, immediately park in an area that is clear of trees, powerlines and water courses. Stay inside your car.
    Stay clam. Keep listening to your ABC Local Radio station listen online or via the ABC Radio app, and/or check ABC Emergency's Twitter and Facebook accounts for updates and instructions.
    If safe to do so, contact your ABC Local Radio station to tell the listeners what you can see. First-hand and reliable knowledge about what's going on will help the rest of the community. Keep our phone number handy.

<h3>After</h3>
The time immediately after a cyclone is often just as dangerous as the initial event itself.
    Deaths and injuries often happen when people go exploring and sightseeing. 

Once the cyclone has passed:

    Listen to your radio and remain indoors until an official all clear has been given by the authorities.
    If you are told to return to your home, do so using the recommended routes only.
    Do not go sightseeing.
    Check on your neighbours, family and friends.
    Get electrical appliances which have been wet-checked before using them.
    Boil or purify your water until supplies are declared safe.
    Stay away from damaged powerlines, fallen trees and flood water.
    If your home has become uninhabitable, contact your local council and ask where you can get help



<h2 id="C3">Earthquake</h2>
If you are indoors during an earthquake

Ensure you do the following if you are indoors during an earthquake:

    DROP to the ground; take COVER by getting under a sturdy table or other piece of furniture; and HOLD ON until the shaking stops. If there isn’t a table or desk near you, cover your face and head with your arms and crouch in an inside corner of the building.
    Stay away from glass, windows, outside doors and walls, and anything that could fall, such as lighting fixtures or furniture.
    Stay in bed if you are there when the earthquake strikes. Hold on and protect your head with a pillow, unless you are under a heavy light fixture that could fall. In that case, move to the nearest safe place.
    Do not use a doorway except if you know it is a strongly supported, load-bearing doorway and it is close to you. Many inside doorways are lightly constructed and do not offer protection.
    Stay inside until the shaking stops and it is safe to go outside. Do not exit a building during the shaking. Research has shown that most injuries occur when people inside buildings attempt to move to a different location inside the building or try to leave.
    DO NOT use the elevators.
    Be aware that the electricity may go out or the sprinkler systems or fire alarms may turn on.

If you are outdoors during an earthquake

Ensure you do the following if you are outdoors during an earthquake:

    Stay there.
    Move away from buildings, streetlights, and utility wires.
    Once in the open, stay there until the shaking stops. The greatest danger exists directly outside buildings, at exits and alongside exterior walls.

If you are in a moving vehicle during an earthquake

Ensure you do the following if you are in a moving vehicle during an earthquake:

    Stop as quickly as safety permits and stay in the vehicle. Avoid stopping near or under buildings, trees, overpasses, and utility wires.
    Proceed cautiously once the earthquake has stopped. Avoid roads, bridges, or ramps that might have been damaged by the earthquake.

If you are trapped under debris

Ensure you do the following if you are trapped under debris during or after an earthquake:

    Do not light a match.
    Do not move around or kick up dust.
    Cover your mouth with a handkerchief or clothing.
    Tap on a pipe or wall so rescuers can locate you. Use a whistle if one is available. Shout only as a last resort. Shouting can cause you to inhale dangerous amounts of dust.



<h2 id="C4">Drought</h2>
<h3>Before a Drought</h3>

Strategies for drought preparedness focus mainly on water conservation. Make these practices a part of your daily life and help preserve this essential resource.
Indoor Water Conservation Tips Prior to a Drought

GENERAL

    Never pour water down the drain when there may be another use for it. For example, use it to water your indoor plants or garden.
    Repair dripping faucets by replacing washers. One drop per second wastes 2,700 gallons of water per year.
    Check all plumbing for leaks and have any leaks repaired by a plumber.
    Retrofit all household faucets by installing aerators with flow restrictors.
    Install an instant hot water heater on your sink.
    Insulate your water pipes to reduce heat loss and prevent them from breaking.
    Install a water-softening system only when the minerals in the water would damage your pipes. Turn the softener off while on vacation.
    Choose appliances that are more energy and water efficient.

BATHROOM

    Consider purchasing a low-volume toilet that uses less than half the water of older models. Note: In many areas, low-volume units are required by law.
    Install a toilet displacement device to cut down on the amount of water needed to flush. Place a one-gallon plastic jug of water into the tank to displace toilet flow (do not use a brick, it may dissolve and loose pieces may cause damage to the internal parts). Be sure installation does not interfere with the operating parts.
    Replace your showerhead with an ultra-low-flow version.

KITCHEN

    Start a compost pile as an alternate method of disposing of food waste or simply dispose of food in the garbage. (Kitchen sink disposals require a lot of water to operate properly).

Outdoor Water Conservation Tips Prior to a Drought

GENERAL

    Check your well pump periodically. If the automatic pump turns on and off while water is not being used, you have a leak.
    Plant native and/or drought-tolerant grasses, ground covers, shrubs, and trees. Once established, plants adapted to your local climate do not need water as frequently and usually will survive a dry period without watering. Small plants require less water to become established. Group plants together based on similar water needs.
    Install irrigation devices that are the most water efficient for each use, such as micro and drip irrigation, and soaker hoses.
    Use mulch to retain moisture in the soil. Mulch also helps control weeds that compete with landscape plants for water.
    Avoid purchasing recreational water toys that require a constant stream of water.
    Avoid installing ornamental water features (such as fountains) unless they use re-circulated water.
    Consider rainwater harvesting where practical.
    Contact your local water provider for information and assistance.

LAWN CARE

    Position sprinklers so water lands on the lawn and shrubs and not on paved areas.
    Repair sprinklers that spray a fine mist. Most misting issues result from a pressure problem, properly regulating pressure in an irrigation system will prevent misting.
    Check sprinkler systems and timing devices regularly to be sure they operate properly.
    Raise the lawn mower blade to at least three inches or to its highest level. A higher cut encourages grass roots to grow deeper, shades the root system, and holds soil moisture.
    Plant drought-resistant lawn seed. Reduce or eliminate lawn areas that are not used frequently.
    Avoid over-fertilizing your lawn. Applying fertilizer increases the need for water. Apply fertilizers that contain slow-release, water-insoluble forms of nitrogen.
    Choose a water-efficient irrigation system such as drip irrigation for your trees, shrubs, and flowers.
    Turn irrigation down in fall and off in winter. Water manually in winter only if needed.
    Put a layer of mulch around trees and plants to reduce evaporation and keep the soil cool. Organic mulch also improves the soil and prevents weeds.
    Invest in a weather-based irrigation controller—or a smart controller. These devices will automatically adjust the watering time and frequency based on soil moisture, rain, wind, and evaporation and transpiration rates. Check with your local water agency to see if there is a rebate available for the purchase of a smart controller.

POOL

    Install a new water-saving pool filter. A single back flushing with a traditional filter uses 180 to 250 gallons of water.
    Cover pools and spas to reduce evaporation of water.

<h3>During a Drought</h3>

Always observe state and local restrictions on water use during a drought. If restricted, for example, do not water your lawn, wash your car, or other non-essential uses, to help ensure there is enough water for essential uses. Contact your state or local government for current information and suggestions.
Indoor Water Conservation Tips While in a Drought

BATHROOM

    Avoid flushing the toilet unnecessarily. Dispose of tissues, insects, and other similar waste in the trash rather than the toilet.
    Avoid taking baths—take short showers—turn on water only to get wet and lather and then again to rinse off.
    Avoid letting the water run while brushing your teeth, washing your face or shaving.
    Place a bucket in the shower to catch excess water for watering plants.

KITCHEN

    Operate automatic dishwashers only when they are fully loaded. Use the "light wash" feature, if available, to use less water.
    Hand wash dishes by filling two containers—one with soapy water and the other with rinse water containing a small amount of chlorine bleach.
    Clean vegetables in a pan filled with water rather than running water from the tap.
    Store drinking water in the refrigerator. Do not let the tap run while you are waiting for water to cool.
    Avoid wasting water waiting for it to get hot. Capture it for other uses such as plant watering or heat it on the stove or in a microwave.
    Avoid rinsing dishes before placing them in the dishwasher; just remove large particles of food. (Most dishwashers can clean soiled dishes very well, so dishes do not have to be rinsed before washing)
    Avoid using running water to thaw meat or other frozen foods. Defrost food overnight in the refrigerator or use the defrost setting on your microwave oven.

LAUNDRY

    Operate automatic clothes washers only when they are fully loaded or set the water level for the size of your load.

Outdoor Water Conservation Tips While in a Drought

CAR WASHING

    Use a commercial car wash that recycles water.
    If you wash your own car, use a shut-off nozzle that can be adjusted down to a fine spray on your hose.

LAWN CARE

    Avoid over watering your lawn and water only when needed:
    A heavy rain eliminates the need for watering for up to two weeks. Most of the year, lawns only need one inch of water per week.
    Check the soil moisture levels with a soil probe, spade or large screwdriver. You don't need to water if the soil is still moist. If your grass springs back when you step on it, it doesn't need water yet.
    If your lawn does require watering, do so early in the morning or later in the evening, when temperatures are cooler.
    Check your sprinkler system frequently and adjust sprinklers so only your lawn is watered and not the house, sidewalk, or street.
    Water in several short sessions rather than one long one, in order for your lawn to better absorb moisture and avoid runoff.
    Use a broom or blower instead of a hose to clean leaves and other debris from your driveway or sidewalk.
    Avoid leaving sprinklers or hoses unattended. A garden hose can pour out 600 gallons or more in only a few hours.
    In extreme drought, allow lawns to die in favor of preserving trees and large shrubs.
